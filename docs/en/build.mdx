# Build In Production

Next, we build the project in production mode and preview the output.


## 1. Build

Execute the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

After execution, a dist directory will be generated in the `.island` directory, which is our packaged product.

## 2. Preview

Execute the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
npm run preview
```

After the execution is completed, the terminal will display a local preview address, and you can see the preview page when you open it in the browser.
