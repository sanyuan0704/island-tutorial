# Write Markdown

After configuring the nav bar and sidebar, we can start writing markdown content.

<CH.Spotlight>

```bash Directory
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ guide
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ getting-started.md
```

---

**Step 1**

Create two Markdown files named `index.md` and `getting-started.md`. The structure looks like this:

```bash Directory
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
# focus
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ guide
# focus
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ getting-started.md
```

---

**Step2**

Create the content of the Home page, the `index.md` file. Add the following to the `index.md` file:

```md index.md
---
pageType: home

hero:
  name: My Awesome Site
  text: My Site
  tagline: This is my awesome site

      text: Getting Started
      link: /guide/getting-started
    - theme: alt
      text: GitHub

```

**Step 3**

Import the Logo image, create a `logo.png` (other image formats are also acceptable) file, and put this image in the `docs/public` directory:

```bash Directory
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
# focus(1,2)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public
        â””â”€â”€ logo.png
```

---

**Step4**

Write a `getting-started.md` file and add the following:

```md getting-started.md
# Getting Started

## Install

This is my first page.

:::tip
Island.js is built on top of Vite.
:::
```

**Step5**

Now, you can start the development server to preview the effect. Run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
# Start command
npm run dev

# Preview Url
http://localhost:5173
http://localhost:5173/guide/getting-started
```

At this point, a simple Island.js site is built. You can continue to add more pages and content according to your needs. Next, let's take a look at how to build the project in the production environment through Island.js.
